# المسبحة (AlMisbahah) - Electronic Tasbih/Rosary

AlMisbahah (المسبحة) is a simple and user-friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help you keep track of your daily dhikr (remembrances of Allah). It works seamlessly online and offline once installed on your device, and it saves your progress.

This application is intended as a "صدقة جارية" (ongoing charity).

## Key Features

*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable on your device (mobile or desktop) and works offline.
*   **Dhikr Counter:** Easily count various pre-defined dhikr.
*   **Persistent Counts:** Saves your current count for each dhikr.
*   **Record Keeping:** Remembers the overall highest count achieved across all dhikr.
*   **Share Functionality:** Share the app with others via WhatsApp, Telegram, or by copying a link.
*   **Daily Reminders:** Option to enable daily notifications to remind you of your dhikr (requires user permission).
*   **Arabic Interface:** The primary language of the application is Arabic.
*   **Privacy-Focused:** All data is stored locally on your device using browser storage.

## How to Use

1.  **Select a Dhikr:** Scroll down to the "اختر ذكراً للبدء" (Choose a Dhikr to Start) section. Click on any dhikr card from the list. The selected dhikr will be displayed at the top.
2.  **Increment Counter:** Tap anywhere on the large counter area at the top (where the count and selected dhikr are displayed) to increment the count. Each tap increases the count by one.
3.  **Reset Counter:** To reset the current count for the *selected dhikr only*, click the "إعادة الضبط" (Reset) button located at the top-right of the counter area. This does not affect your overall highest record or counts for other dhikr.
4.  **View Progress:**
    *   The current count for the selected dhikr is shown in large numbers.
    *   "الرقم القياسي" (Highest Record) displays the highest count you've ever achieved for any single dhikr session.
5.  **Switch Dhikr:** Simply click on a different dhikr card from the selection area. The app will save the current progress for the previously selected dhikr and display the progress for the newly selected one.

## Installation / Offline Use (PWA)

AlMisbahah is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it on your smartphone or computer for easy access and offline use.

*   **On Mobile (iOS/Android):**
    1.  Open the website in your browser (e.g., Safari, Chrome).
    2.  Tap the "Share" button (often an icon with an arrow pointing upwards or three dots).
    3.  Look for an option like **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install app"** and tap it.
*   **On Desktop (e.g., Chrome, Edge):**
    1.  Navigate to the website.
    2.  Look for an install icon in the address bar (often a computer screen with a downward arrow) or an option in the browser's menu (usually three dots) like **"Install AlMisbahah..."** or **"Install this site as an application"**.

Once installed, the app will function like any other native app on your device and will work even without an internet connection. The share popup within the app also provides a hint for installation.

## Sharing the App

The application encourages sharing as an act of ongoing charity ("صدقة جارية"). You can easily share AlMisbahah with friends and family using the built-in share buttons:

*   **Top Bar:** Quick share buttons for WhatsApp, Telegram, and copying the link are available at the very top of the page.
*   **Share Popup:** A popup (which appears once per session for non-installed PWA users or can be manually triggered) provides more context and share options.

Sharing the app helps others benefit from it and contributes to the ongoing charity. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: *"The one who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer."* (Sahih Muslim)

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA) principles:**
    *   Service Worker for offline capabilities and caching.
    *   Web App Manifest for installability.
*   **No external frameworks or libraries** are used for the core functionality, keeping the app lightweight and fast.
